# CHAPTER_7
Adding Animation to an App


This chapter teaches me how to incorporate animation into my app to enhance user experience (UX) by conveying actions and adding visual interest. It highlights the importance of using animations appropriately, as excessive or unnecessary animations can negatively impact UX. The chapter introduces how to creating Tween animations and demonstrates how to leverage built-in Flutter animations with widgets like AnimatedContainer, AnimatedCrossFade, and AnimatedOpacity. Iâ€™ll also learn how to create custom animations using the AnimationController and AnimatedBuilder classes, which offer greater flexibility. The chapter explores creating staggered animations with multiple Animation classes for complex, sequential effects, and introduces the CurvedAnimation class to create nonlinear animation effects.
